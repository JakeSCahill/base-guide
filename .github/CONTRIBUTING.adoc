= Contributing to Hazelcast Tutorials

This guide covers how to use this template to contribute to Hazelcast tutorials.

== Repository Structure

All tutorials follow the same structure:

- `.github/workflows/build-site.yml`: A build hook that builds the documentation site when a change is merged.
- `docs/`: Source content in the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/standard-directories/[standard Antora file and directory structure].
- `create.sh`: A script that converts the Asciidoc files in the `docs/` directory to a PDF. This script requires the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/cli/[Asciidoctor CLI] to be installed.

== Adding a New Tutorial
 
. Create a new repository, using this link:https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/base-guide[template].
+
TIP: Use a brief name for the new repository as it will be the endpoint of the tutorial when it's published.

. Rename the file in `docs/modules/ROOT/pages` to the name of your repository.

. Add the filename to the template in the README.

. Write your tutorial by following the instructions in the file.

. Submit a pull request against the link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docs[`hazelcast-docs` repository] to append your tutorial repository to the `content.sources` field in the `antora-playbook.yml` and `antora-playbook-local.yml` files.
+
For example:
+
```yaml
content:
  sources:
    - url: https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/<your-repo>
    branches: main
    start_path: docs
```
+
After the pull request is merged, your tutorial will be available on the documentation site in ~10 minutes.
